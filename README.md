Module 5 Challenge 5 6/9/23
## Description
I think this hourly calendar app is neat. This product is benfecial to all and helps the user with time management. While developing under the hood, I learned more about Jquery and its syntax. This project was easiar to approach because it had a guide with todo's and the html and css were given. 

## Installation

n/a

## Usage
Upon arriving to the page there will be current day displayed, and a hourly calendar from 9am to 5pm.
When it is grey, the hours have past. When it is red, you are on the current hour. When it is green, the hours are in the future. 
You can write your agenda and input text, and save the text when you press the save button.
Your data will store in local storage, and upon refreshing or returning, your data will stil display.
